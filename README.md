# RFM-Analysis-in-Python
### Why RFM?
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing model using customer segmentation based on their transaction history.
- This model could be very useful, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited marketing resources, helping them focus on the potentially right customer segments to increase ROI, reduce churn, reduce cost, improve customer relationship, and a lot more.

### How?
- In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores.
